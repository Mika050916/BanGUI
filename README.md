This plugin is designed for people using PM5. It adds a system of bans, mutes, kicks and warns to the server with a GUI menu.
In the config, you can create your own permissions in which you specify the maximum ban/mute time for each permission you create.
Also, if there is a newplugin.nomessage permission, a button will appear in the GUI menu, when clicked, a message about a bath/kick/mute or warns will not be sent to the global chat.
